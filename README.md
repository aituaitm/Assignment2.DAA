# Min-Heap Implementation (Assignment 2 - Algorithmic Analysis and Peer Code Review)

## Author
**Aitmukasheva Akbota**, Group SE-2425

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Min-Heap data structure** with advanced functionality including:
- `insert(int value)`
- `extractMin()`
- `decreaseKey(int index, int newValue)`
- `merge(MinHeap other)`

All operations are tracked for **comparisons**, **swaps**, and **array accesses** using the `PerformanceTracker` utility.

## Goals
This work fulfills the requirements for *Assignment 2: Algorithmic Analysis and Peer Code Review* in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course.

### Learning Outcomes
- Implement efficient algorithms with correct asymptotic analysis.
- Perform peer code review with optimization suggestions.
- Validate theoretical complexity through empirical benchmarks.

## üìä Algorithm Complexity
| Operation | Best | Average | Worst | Space |
|------------|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Insert | O(1) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(1) |
| Extract Min | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(1) |
| Decrease Key | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(1) |
| Merge | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
